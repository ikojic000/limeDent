LimeDent is a Java application designed for managing a dental practice and patients, generating PDF quotes, and saving them. The MySQL database is used as the data storage, while the custom Java Swing components make up the GUI interface. The MVC design pattern was followed in programming the application, and Command and Observer design patterns and multithreading were used to improve the user experience. The GUI design uses GridBag Layout and MiG Layout (Menu panel) to allow the Menu panel to be enlarged or reduced as desired. The database class follows the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the class exists during the application's life cycle. The User, Product, Patient, Offer, OfferTblPreviewData, and MedicalExam classes represent the objects with which the application works, and the TableModels package contains classes for models for all tables used in the application. Finally, the DAO package contains classes for working with data from the database.
