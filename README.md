# limeDent

LimeDent is a dental clinic management application that allows dentists and their staff to manage patient information and generate PDF quotes. The application was developed using the Java programming language and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The user interface (UI) was built using custom Java Swing components and features a full responsive design utilizing GridBag Layout and MiG Layout for the Menu panel.

The Menu panel consists of header, menu, and footer parts. The header displays the logged-in user's information such as their name, surname, and profile photo, while the footer contains buttons that lead the user to the UserSettingsPanel where they can modify their own settings and a button to exit the application. The main/Menu section contains buttons that lead the user to other parts of the application such as the HomePanel, UslugePanel, PonudePanel, NovaPonudaPanel, and CalendarPanel.

The database for LimeDent is built using the MySQL database management system, and the Database class follows the Singleton design pattern. The getDatabase() method checks whether an instance of the class exists in the application, and if not, it creates one. This ensures that there is only one instance of the class throughout the application's life cycle. The DatabaseConnectionThread class is used to create a new thread that runs in parallel with the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) and checks whether a connection to the database has been established. If the connection is not established, the thread tries to establish it again.

LimeDent has various model classes that represent the objects that the application works with. These models partially represent the tables in the database. The models include User, Product, Patient, Offer, OfferTblPreviewData, and MedicalExam. Each class contains corresponding fields and attributes as well as various constructors that use certain attributes. The User class creates objects that represent end-users, the Patient class creates objects that represent patients, the MedicalExam class represents patient exams, the Offer class represents quotes, and the OfferTblPreviewData class creates objects that we use when creating quotes. The presentation table in the NovaPonudaPanel is populated with objects of these classes.

The TableModels package contains classes for the models of all the tables used in the application. Each class extends AbstractTableModel and has properties that the table to which it belongs needs. The PatientTableModel belongs to the table on the HomePanel that displays all patients, the ProductTableModel belongs to the table on the UslugePanel that displays all services, the MedicalExamTableModel belongs to the table on the NoviPregledPanel that displays the selected patient's exams, the OfferTableModel belongs to the table on the PonudePanel that displays all quotes, and the OfferTblPreviewModel belongs to the table on the NovaPonudaPanel where we place objects of the OfferTblPreviewData class when adding a service to a quote.

The DAO package, or DataAccessObject, contains classes that work with data from the database. Since the database contains tables for users, services, patients, quotes, and exams, we have DAO classes for all of these tables. The DAO classes contain methods for inserting, updating, and deleting data in the database, as well as methods for retrieving data from the database. The DAO classes use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to the database and execute SQL queries.

Overall, LimeDent is a powerful dental clinic management application that features a well-designed UI, efficient database management, and advanced functionality to provide a better user experience.
